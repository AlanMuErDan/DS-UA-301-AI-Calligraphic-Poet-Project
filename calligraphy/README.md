# Calligraphy Generation

## Data

Data needed is varied for **GAN** and **CycleGAN** model. 

## GAN

## CycleGAN

## Comparison

We use two evaluation metrics to evaluate different models:

- **Consistent Score:** We trained a CNN-based classification model to differentiate between various calligraphy styles. After comparing several architectures, we selected DenseNet as the base model. The well-trained DenseNet model serves as a style-consistent feature extractor. To rigorously evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to learn styles, we calculate the cosine similarity between the generated images and the real images. You can train your own feature extractor in the *train_classifier* folder. The calculation function is stored in *utils* folder name ``calculate_style_consistency_score.py``.
